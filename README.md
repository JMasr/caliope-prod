The Caliope Project is a comprehensive toolkit developed by the [Multimedia Technologies Group](https://gtm.uvigo.es/en/)  at the **atlanTTic Research Center, Universidade de Vigo**. This project, conducted under the TILGA initiative in collaboration with the [Cluster Audiovisual Galego](https://www.clusteraudiovisualgalego.com/), aims to enhance transcriptions by adding capitalization and punctuation.

The **Caliope-Toolkit** currently supports Spanish and Galician languages, with the flexibility to incorporate additional languages in the future.

This repository provides an implementation of the Caliope Toolkit using **Pytorch**.
